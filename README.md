# Used Car Price Prediction 🚗💰

## Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the price of used cars based on various features such as brand, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and more. The goal is to help buyers and sellers make informed decisions by estimating the fair market value of a vehicle.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning to handle missing values and outliers.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand key trends and correlations.
- Feature engineering and selection to improve model performance.
- Implementation of multiple regression and machine learning models for price prediction.
- Model evaluation using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R².
- Interactive visualization of results.

## Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📒
- Pandas & NumPy (for data manipulation)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for model training and evaluation)
- Flask (optional, if deployed as a web app)
